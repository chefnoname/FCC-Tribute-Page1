            <p>The Quba Mosque (Arabic: مَسْجِد قُبَاء) is a mosque located on the outskirts
                of Medina, Saudi Arabia. Initially, the mosque was built 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) off Medina in the
                village of Quba, before Medina expanded to include this village.

                According to records, its first
                stones were positioned by Muhammad &#65018 as soon as he arrived on his emigration from the city of
                Mecca
                to
                Medina,[5] and the mosque was completed by his companions. Muhammad &#65018 spent 14 days in this mosque
                praying
                qaṣr (Arabic: قَـصْـر‎, a short prayer) while waiting for Ali to arrive in Medina.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="mobile-view">

                The latter
                stayed behind in Mecca to safeguard Muhammad’s &#65018 life and safe escape by sleeping in Muhammad’s
                &#65018 bed in his
                place, an event referred to in the Quran, Sura al-Baqara verse 207. Also going along with traditional
                saying, this mosque is said to be where the first Friday prayer was held, led by Muhammad &#65018.
